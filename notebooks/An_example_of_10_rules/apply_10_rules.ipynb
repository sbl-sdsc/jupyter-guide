    "In this exercise, I am planning to use bar charts and maps to demonstrate the current status of coronavirus. especially the number of deaths, the number of patients and the number of recovered people. There are mainly two types of information that should be encoded, one is the number of patients, another one is the corresponding country. The first one is a quantitative variable and the second one is the nominal variable.\n",

    "According to **The Mackinlay ranking of perceptual task**, a nice option to encode these two variables is to use bar chart because we can use one axis to encode the nominal variable and another axis to encode the quantitative variable. According to Steven's power law, comparing things in length will give the most accurate result. \n",

    "Therefore, when we want to compare the quantities, the bar chart should be the primary choice. In this task, the quantity we need to encode is the number of patients in each country, and it depicts the severity of coronavirus in the corresponding country. By comparing the quantities in different countries, we could gain an overview of the current status of coronavirus. "

    "As mentioned above, the bar chart is useful when we want to encode a quantitative variable and a nominal variable. Putting bars side by side will give us the most accurate result of the comparison. But we could also use it when we want to encode a quantitative variable and an ordinal variable. One example for it is the histogram where the y-axis demonstrates the counts or probability densities, and the x-axis interprets the intervals of data. Therefore, when we are doing a random experiment, the bar chart is almost always applied to explore the experimental data.\n",

Otherwise, the objects we need to compare in the figure are not the lengths of bars, but the areas of them. According to The Mackinlay ranking of the perceptual task, comparing areas is not very accurate."

    "The very first thing we need to do is data cleaning such as dealing with the missing data, removing unnecessary columns and transforming the data (wide format to long format). After that, we need to define the type of plot that will be used. Some plots that are commonly used are line graph, scatter plot, bar chart, stacked area graph and box plot. After defining the type, the only thing that we need to do is putting the variables and the corresponding data properties (quantitative, ordinal or nominal) into axes. Some refinements can be made after that for improving readability and effectiveness. \n",

    "Altair has some downsides:\n",
    "1. It has limited customization options. Unlike Matplotlib, all types of the plot are predefined in the library of Altair, you can only choose one of them to perform visualization. For example, there is no option of using pie chart in Altair, and users cannot do much about it.\n",
    "2. The power of processing data is limited. I don't know why, but Altair cannot handle the data frames which have more than 5000 rows. This is a serious downside because in the period of big data people often need to deal with data in PB which is certainly not suitable for Altair. \n",
    "\n",
    "But I still prefer Altair especially when I only need to visualize small amounts of data in the spreadsheets, because **it is a declarative and it integrates with Jupyter nicely**. Although there are many other visualization libraries available for Python such as Matplotlib, Bokeh, Seaborn, etc., I still choose Altair to perform this task simply because:\n",

    "1. **Tell a story for an audience**: This rule emphasizes the interaction between authors and audiences by showing the audiences not only the codes but also the story behind the data and the process of thoughts of telling the story. The audiences of this notebook are probably the TAs and classmates in this course, so I need to demonstrate the figures in order to give intuitive pictures to audiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Document the process, not just the results**: This rule emphasizes that the authors should tell audiences how to clean data and how to achieve the results. In this exercise, comments and texts are used to show the audiences how I get the data, clean them and plot them finally.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use cell division**: This rule refers to the well-structured notebook which has high readability. We should try to avoid the cells that contain too many contents. It is better to have only one task (loading data, data cleaning, or plotting) in one cell. In this notebook, there are mainly three parts, and each part includes roughly 4 cells, two for markdowns and two for data cleaning and plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Design your notebooks to be read, run, and explored**: This rule asks the authors to ensure that the audiences can access, run, and explore the notebook. Because most data are obtained from the internet, it should be worried that the audiences might not access those data if the given links do not work anymore. Therefore, I save all the data in CSV files and put them in Github with the notebook to avoid the problems of accessing data. "
